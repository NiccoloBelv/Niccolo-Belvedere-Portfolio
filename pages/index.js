              <p>In 2019, after years living in my home country, Maratea, I moved to Milan to pursue my studies in Business Administration and Management at Bocconi University. 
              In the following years I took part in several projects, which can be consulted in the Projects area of this portfolio, 
              until I spent an exchange semester in Ottawa (Canada) during my third year of Bachelor, at the Telfer School of Management. 
              Subsequently, in 2022 I started my Master of Science in Management, which led me to an internship at Amazon Business from June 2023 to December 2023 in the area of Business Development and Account Management.</p>

              <p>From early on I developed a passion for tech and innovation: during my third year of high school science (2017) I took part in a school work experience on how to develop a startup from 0, 
              creating a prototype and a business model. In 2022, a colleague and I won a "Call4Ideas", drafting an idea about a platform to improve the supply chain of NGOs and presenting the project in front of a jury at the SDA School of Management. 
              Afterwards, I am taking courses and doing self-taught practices to learn coding with various languages.
              I strongly believe that this new technological era will change the course of our lives, and I want to be part of this change.</p>

                The thesis outlines the significance of interactions between public and private sectors in shaping a nation's economic condition, emphasizing that the essence of a nation's economy is not merely the sum of these sectors, but the result of their continual interplay. <br />Central to this dynamic is human capital. The public sector's regulatory role, financing, and infrastructure development are highlighted as influential factors on private sector activities. The paper focuses on the criticality of placing competent individuals within public organizations since their caliber directly impacts national performance across both sectors.
                The discourse pivots to a comparative analysis of two civil service systems: career-based and position-based. It includes an examination of how human resource (HR) management tools adapt to each system and a detailed exploration of HR practices in Italy and France (career-based) and Canada and England (position-based). <br />An interview with Dr. Trombetti Lilia from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunication Commission provides insights into the practical applications of Canada's position-based system.
                The discussion advances to various topics, such as the superior civil service system, evaluation methods for these systems, recruitment strategies for top talent in public institutions, and applicable lessons for Italy. The analysis concludes by revealing how the choice between the two models can underpin a nation's development under specific circumstances, and it reinforces the notion that human resources are pivotal to societal progress.

                The "Big Data Report" examines the European Central Bank's (ECB) communication strategies and their impact on financial markets. Focusing on the ECB presidencies of Mario Draghi and Christine Lagarde, the report analyzes speeches and monetary policy statements from November 2011 to June 2023.<br />It employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling and linear regression models to investigate the relationship between ECB communication and various financial measures such as the IOS rate, EUR/USD exchange rate, and Italian and German government bond yields.<br />
                The study observes significant differences in the communication styles and focus areas of Draghi and Lagarde. Draghi's tenure is characterized by concise, direct communication, primarily addressing macroeconomic themes during the European financial crisis. In contrast, Lagarde's period is marked by longer, more detailed discussions, with a broader focus due to events like the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical instabilities. 
                The report identifies themes like "Asset Convergence," "Financial Conditions," "Structural Stability," and "Inflation Expectations" as significantly influencing financial metrics. The study concludes with a discussion of limitations and areas for future research, emphasizing the need for continuous examination of central bank communications and their financial implications.

                In the "Corporate Strategy Report" for Microsoft Inc., a multifaceted analytical approach was employed to comprehensively evaluate the company’s operations and strategic direction. Initially, the report outlined Microsoft’s corporate strategy, emphasizing its synergic approach that integrates resources and operations across different segments like technology, marketing, and sales. This holistic view painted a picture of Microsoft's portfolio strategy.<br /> 
                The business analysis segment delved into Microsoft's various operational sectors, including software, cloud computing, gaming, and hardware. Each of these sectors was thoroughly examined to assess current performance, market position, and growth potential. The software segment, for example, was broken down into its constituent services and products, while cloud computing was highlighted, particularly Azure, for its profitability and growth trajectory.<br /> 
                A PESTEL analysis was then conducted to understand the external factors influencing Microsoft's business environment.
                Following this, a detailed micro-level analysis of each business segment was carried out. 
                One of the report's focal points was the strategy for integrating artificial intelligence across Microsoft's business units. The analysis here was twofold: it first assessed the strategic importance of AI integration and then explored potential avenues for acquiring AI capabilities.<br /> 
                The report also paid close attention to Microsoft’s commitments to social and environmental sustainability, underscoring its CSR initiatives and strategies.<br /> 
                Finally, the report wrapped up with a series of strategic recommendations. These recommendations were based on the comprehensive analyses conducted throughout the report, suggesting future directions and adjustments Microsoft could consider for continued growth and market leadership.

                The "Asset Management Report" focuses on the Blackrock ESG Multi Asset Fund, a multi-asset class fund with €5.428.14 million in net assets as of October 31, 2023. The fund's investment strategy includes a blend of global equities, fixed income, alternative instruments, and liquidity, prioritizing investments that adhere to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles.<br />
                The report is divided into two main parts: Style Analysis and Risk Measurement. In the Style Analysis section, the report examines the fund's investments in different geographical regions and sectors, employing Sharpe style analysis. It aims to determine the fund's position in terms of risk and return by comparing its cumulative returns with specific benchmarks and the efficient frontier.<br />
                In the Risk Measurement section, the report describes the absolute and relative risk measures for the fund, focusing on the Value at Risk (VaR) and Relative Value at Risk (ReVaR) indicators over a two-year period.<br />
                Overall, the report provides a detailed evaluation of the Blackrock ESG Multi Asset Fund, offering insights into its investment strategy, performance in varying market scenarios, and commitment to ESG principles. It also assesses the fund's risk-return characteristics and examines how it adapts and performs against benchmarks and market trends.

                The presentation discusses the concept, pros and cons, and regulatory aspects of cash-out mergers.<br />
                The presentation delves into agency costs arising from the conflicting interests of controlling and minority shareholders and directors versus minority shareholders. It highlights how cash-out mergers can create advantages but also risks of injustices for minority shareholders.<br />
                Moreover, it compares long-form and short-form mergers in the U.S., with an analysis of the regulatory landscape in Europe. It discusses the various legal frameworks and protections in place to balance the interests of controlling and minority shareholders. Then, it lists points in favor of cash-out mergers and points against these mergers.<br />
                In conclusion, the presentation suggests that cash-out mergers can be beneficial if regulated properly, with sufficient protection for minority shareholders. It recommends following the U.S. model, particularly Delaware's jurisprudence, as an example of providing flexibility and protection in cash-out mergers.

                This project presents a detailed strategy for implementing sustainability and circular economy practices within Decathlon and aims to integrate a "Zero Waste" feature into Decathlon. This initiative is designed to guide customers on responsibly managing their used Decathlon products and encompasses a holistic approach to product lifecycle management.<br />
                The strategy incorporates a creative upcycling and repairing section in the app, where customers are encouraged to refurbish or repurpose their products using detailed tutorials available through links to Decathlon's YouTube channel. For products beyond repair, the app provides guidance on locating nearby waste collection centers to ensure responsible disposal. Additionally, customers have the option to return used products to Decathlon stores.<br />
                The plan includes setting up centralized repair hubs across Italy, optimized for various refurbishment processes like mechanics, electronics, painting, and welding.<br />
                The reconditioned products will be available for purchase or rental, expanding the reach of Decathlon's Rent division. This initiative not only aligns with the increasing consumer trend towards sustainable and second-hand products, particularly among Millennials and Gen Z, but also positions Decathlon as a leader in sustainable retail practices.<br /> 
                The overall strategy encompasses app development, content creation for repair and upcycling, hiring and training new staff for repair and in-store operations, and establishing the necessary infrastructure for the repair hubs and in-store rental and sales stations. Through this integrated approach, Decathlon aims to enhance its sustainability profile while increasing its market share in the refurbished product segment.

                The "Pane Quotidiano Report" presents a strategic approach to enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of Pane Quotidiano's (PQ) operations, particularly its supply chain, from relationships with suppliers to the management and organization of packages for distribution. The report emphasizes the use of innovative solutions in the supply chain as a means to increase the effectiveness of PQ's actions and reduce costs.<br />
                To achieve these objectives, the report proposes the implementation of a new communication platform for donors and suppliers, integrated with a database to provide real-time information on products in the warehouse. This platform aims to streamline the donation process, making it easier for suppliers and casual donors to meet PQ's demands. Additionally, the report suggests utilizing the "Microsoft Cloud for Non-Profit" to improve various areas of the organization, including logistics and donor management.
                Furthermore, a partnership with E-Mobility is recommended to address the need for vehicles in collecting and delivering goods more efficiently. This collaboration could provide PQ with access to vehicles at no cost, optimizing costs and freeing up resources for other tasks.
                <br />Another significant proposal is the "New Mobility Project," which aims to reach people in need in different areas of the city. This project would involve setting up a mobile unit in a strategic location to distribute pre-packaged goods. The report highlights the importance of careful planning in choosing the location and format of this distribution to maximize impact and efficiency.<br />
                In conclusion, the report posits that by adopting these innovative logistics and partnership strategies, PQ can reduce costs and reinvest the savings in improving the quality of its operations and extending its services.
